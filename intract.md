By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant
us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to

and translating). This license authorizes us to make your Content available to the
rest of the world and to let others do the same. You agree that this license includes
the right for Intract to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make

organizations or individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, Retweet,

our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such additional uses by Intract, or
other companies, organizations or individuals, is made with no compensation paid
to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise
make available through the Services as the use of the Services by you is hereby
agreed as being sufficient compensation for the Content and grant of rights herein.

Intract has an evolving set of rules for how ecosystem partners can interact with
your Content on the Services. These rules exist to enable an open ecosystem with
your rights in mind. You understand that we may modify or adapt your Content as
it is distributed, syndicated, published, or broadcast by us and our partners and/or
make changes to your Content in order to adapt the Content to different media.

You represent and warrant that you have, or have obtained, all rights, licenses,
consents, permissions, power and/or authority necessary to grant the rights granted
herein for any Content that you submit, post or display on or through the Services.
You agree that such Content will not contain material subject to copyright or other
proprietary rights, unless you have necessary permission or are otherwise legally
entitled to post the material and to grant Intract the license described above.
